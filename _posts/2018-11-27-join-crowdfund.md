Join others in a crowdfund to deploy infrastructure. Together you'll own the production of whatever it creates, such as kWh from solar panels.

## Finding your Project

You can browse available projects to see which meet your preferences.

## Payment

You can choose to pay whatever you want above the minimum. Unlike kickstarter, there's no tiers or reward packages, you'll be rewarded in proportion to your purchase.

Currently, you can only make your purchase using iDeal, a dutch payment provider.
