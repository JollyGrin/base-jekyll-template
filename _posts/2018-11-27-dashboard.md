## Self Sufficiency

![Self-Sufficiency](/images/media/dash-self.png)

The goal of NestEgg is to reduce your basic needs to 0 by owning enough production from a variety of sustainable infrastructure. Such as owning 10% in a solar panel across the country, to receive 10% of the kWh produced and directly reduce your energy bill.

Your self-sufficiency bar can be set to your custom energy levels and will track the kWh produced from all your projects. This helps you track, at a glance, your progress towards reaching 100% self-sufficency, which means your projects would produce enough energy to reduce your energy bill to zero.

## Your Eggs

The total of how much you have invested in all your eggs is at the center-top of your dashboard.

NestEgg calls infrastructure projects, "Eggs". Thus, you can see how many projects (eggs) you have in your portfolio.

Note: this box doesn't track the size of each share. Thus, 1% or 99% ownership of an egg would still be displayed as "1 Egg". To dividend box tracks how much you receive each month.  

## Dividend

When you own shares in a variety of energy projects, they will each produce a portion of kWh. The dividend box aggregates all the kWh coming from your eggs each month, so you can track the euro equivalent of what your total investment creates each month.

## Egg Investments
